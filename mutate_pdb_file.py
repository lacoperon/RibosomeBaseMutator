PDB Nucleotide Mutator

This Python file exists to allow us to `make` tleap interpret nucleotides
of one type as another type, via changing some atom and residue names,
as well as deleting some lines, within the source PDB files.

This script is intentionally not generalizable, because different nucleotide
modifications require different line replacements, and PDB files themselves are
not always formatted the same way.

So, if you're using this, make sure you understand how it works first and
generate the appropriate parameters for `mutate_residue` by hand.
Then you should be golden.

This function alters a PDB file to make one type of residue be interpreted
as another type when passed into TLEAP.

Input:
    resid        : chain name and residue number unique ID   (IE 'A 711')
    newid        : desired chain name and residue number ID  (IE 'G 711')
    delete_atms  : list of atoms that should be deleted (ie ["N6"])
    rename_atms  : list of atoms that should be renamed (ie ["C4"])
    renamed_atms : list of renamed atoms relative to rename_atms (ie ["C6"])
    line         : input line from PDB file
Output:
    appropriately modified line
